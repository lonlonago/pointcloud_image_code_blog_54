#  Overview of the principle 

   The principle of the least squares method is to determine the best function match for a set of data based on minimizing the sum of squares of errors. The principle of its specific fitting circle is as follows. Assuming that the circle equation is known: Equation (1) can be written as: Rewrite equation (2) into the form of the right equal to 0, and convert the formula: Therefore, the values of the three parameters of the above binary quadratic equation can be determined, so as to calculate the radius of the fitting circle and give the coordinates of the center of the circle. The distance from the point in the sample set to the center of the circle: In order to obtain the most accurate fitting of the actual parameters of the circle, use the distance from the sample point to the center of the circle to square the difference with the radius, and find the value that minimizes the sum of squares, that is, the final solution, so as to determine the parameters of the circle and draw the circle.
